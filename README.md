# Hi, I'm Abenezer Anemaw — aka typokrit

> Code. Coffee. Chaos.  
> Welcome to the typokrit zone.

I'm a passionate front-end developer (in training), building clean, responsive websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap — soon diving deeper into React and Tailwind CSS. I love turning ideas into reality and adding my personal twist to every line of code.

### What I'm Working On:
- A portfolio website to showcase my projects
- Telegram bot for movie/series recommendations
- Learning full-stack development (slowly but surely)

### Connect With Me:
- Email: abenianemaw731@gmail.com
- Blog (coming soon): Typokrit's World
- LinkedIn/GitHub: @typokrit
